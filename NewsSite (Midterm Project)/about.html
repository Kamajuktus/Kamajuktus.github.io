    <p><em>"The main problem of quotes on the Internet - is that everyone undoubtely believes them."</em><br>
    &mdash;Vladimir Lenin, 1925 <br> <br>
    "Absolutely False" is a news site, which publishes only fictional news. <br>
    In 2021BC site was founded by Nebkaure Khety the VI, the 10th dynasty pharaoh, in oder to send disinformational news to Ancient Egypt's foe &mdash; libyans. <br> <br>
    290BC &mdash; After the fire in the library of Alexandria, the only papers that were saved were the articles of our journal. Based on survived articles Romans <br>
    started to actively print and spread the most interesting and the most <strong>false</strong> articles. <br> <br>
    In year 0BC Jesus of Nazareth, inspired by our articles, splited the society of Jerusalem and founded Christianity. <br> <br>
    In the beginning of 20th century our greatest editor Karl Marx published his digest of articles called "Kapital". <br> <br>
    1914 &mdash; Unfortunately, Franz Ferdinand, one of the most influential of our editors was shot. The disputes about this event caused Austro-Hungary to declare <br>
    war against Bosnia. <br> <br>
    In present days our controversial articles cause daily disputes about moral rights, meaning of life, politics, nazism, <br>
    racism, fachism, sexism, ontoneurologicalendoposttraumaticalneologism and other very important topics.</p>
